# Lessons Learnt

> Good practices to continue for future projects

- Mark polarity for power connectors. E.g. JST connector should have `+` and `-` labels on silkscreen
- Buy good quality LiPo / battery and power connectors

## V2.0

- Do not use modules as they are big and bulky
- Use DP3T to power on, wireless off and wireless on options instead of 2 switches
- Use a smaller and brighter RGB LED
- Use a single layer board so that a housing can be catered for the battery at the back
